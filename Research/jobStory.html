          I want to look for attractive and intersting people on tinder,
          grabbing my phone to swipe left or right depending on my tastes,
          hoping I match with someone I like.

          I can get to know new people via chat and maybe even meet someone in
          real life, exchanging numbers. I can have some laughs and kill boredom
          by sharing gifs and looking a profiles that look funny to me.
