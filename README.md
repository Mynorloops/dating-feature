# Welcome to my documentation for Project Tech dating-feature
This is a space specifically made for me to work out my project.

My idea for a dating feature is to have users answer questions, then have other users choose questions the first users answered so they can provide their own input. Then both users can compare their answers and see how compatible they are before they like eachother.

The easy way to explain this concept is "Simulating A Date" or a SAM.

![Explanation of concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mynorloops/dating-feature/master/playground/relatedImages/22.png)

This project includes the following dependancies:
* EJS
* Express
* MongoDB
* Pug (tested but not implemented)
* Nodemon (as a devDependency)

## Installation

* You can clone this git repo to a local folder bij downloading it from github or using the "git clone" command on your terminal.
* In order for it to work properly, you your IP adress to be whitelisted from my end.

## A little something about this project:

I'm using Node.js to have my JS files connect with eachother. Every JS has the purpuse of their names. So profiles is used as a local array of information to be used somewhere else and so on.

Sources that helped me make this possible:

* API I want to use for generating the questions later in development: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
