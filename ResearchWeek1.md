# Welcome to my First week

## This is my first Git presentation

**_I know now it works._**

I currently have little to no proper research done since I spent most of my time getting the hang of git and how to use it.
I did however made visual research and added some ideas for insights to the table. I will be working towards a product that focuses on loneliness and how dating apps go about it.

In my research I will tackel dating apps and dating simulators.
